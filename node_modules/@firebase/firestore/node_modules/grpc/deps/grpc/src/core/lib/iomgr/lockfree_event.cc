/* 'state' holds the to call when the fd is readable or writable respectively.
   It can contain one of the following values:
     kClosureReady     : The fd has an I/O event of interest but there is no
                         closure yet to execute

     kClosureNotReady : The fd has no I/O event of interest

     closure ptr       : The closure to be executed when the fd has an I/O
                         event of interest

     shutdown_error | kShutdownBit :
                        'shutdown_error' field ORed with kShutdownBit.
                         This indicates that the fd is shutdown. Since all
                         memory allocations are word-aligned, the lower two
                         bits of the shutdown_error pointer are always 0. So
                         it is safe to OR these with kShutdownBit

   Valid state transitions:

     <closure ptr> <-----3------ kClosureNotReady -----1------->  kClosureReady
